# Fitness Tracker Backend API
API for a Fitness Tracker that I was making on Node JS, not finished at all.

Has a somewhat nice structure.

Configure the .env file and tracker/db.js to start using this as your base.
For the API, go to tracker/handler.js

Registration/Login/Change password/Remember me is fully working featuring AES256
Not sure about workout features
